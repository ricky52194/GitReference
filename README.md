# GitReference
# README  
## Instructions:
Create an app that reads a json file of Git commands and displays all of the commands via a ListView. A gitReference.json file is provided.

## WOW Factors:
1. A SearchView has been implemented to help users search the git references by section. A large pop-up also appears to show what the user has currently typed into the SearchView.
2. An alternating color scheme has been implemented to help users easily distinguish between rows.
